## Overview
The baselines directory contains benchmark evaluation for baseline methods for comparison in our research, organized into two subdirectories: AvisC and OPERA. These include Python scripts for the AMBER and CHAIR benchmarks.

**Note**: Refer to the original repositories for setup and dependency details and then use the scripts in this directory to run them on AMBER and CHAIR benchmarks.

## AvisC Subdirectory
Contains scripts for contrastive decoding methods (VCD, M3ID, AvisC) on the AMBER and CHAIR benchmarks. See the [AvisC](https://github.com/sangminwoo/AvisC) repository for more information.

## OPERA Subdirectory
Contains the script for the OPERA method on the AMBER benchmark. See the [OPERA](https://github.com/shikiw/OPERA/tree/main) repository for more information.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure dataset paths, model checkpoints, and configurations are set correctly in your environment.
- For issues or assistance, consult the original repositories or contact the maintainers.
